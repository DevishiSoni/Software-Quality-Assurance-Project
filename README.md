# Software-Quality-Assurance-Project
This repository is for our software quality assurance semester long project where we will be working on developing a working banking software!

## Please note: 
**Our prototype is written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and we are using Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download) to run it as a console application.**

**To run it as a console:**
1. Copy the GitHub link and clone in VS code
2. Open the project and further open the JS folder
3. From there run a command line (we used Windows Powershell) and type ‘node node.js’
4. The session will be started.
